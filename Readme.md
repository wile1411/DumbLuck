Dumb Luck

Current Version:
v0.0.2

=================
  Description
=================

This mod takes the Kerbal "dumb/stupidity" stat and ties your Kerbals intelligence to their success / failure for repairing parts (Engineer) and resetting experiments (Scientist). It also takes into account the Kerbals Level so that the more stars they have, the less likely they are to fail. I've added an increased chance of failure if the wrong skilled Kerbal makes the attempt. (eg Pilot/Engineer trying to reset a Science Experiment)
